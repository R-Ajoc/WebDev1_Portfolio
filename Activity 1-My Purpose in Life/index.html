                            "I am here to live—not merely to exist. To wake up each day with the courage to choose me, 
                            even when the world tells me not to. To breathe deeply, love fiercely, and chase moments 
                            that make my heart race. I refuse to live in the shadow of regret. Every step I take is a 
                            step towards my dreams, a testament to the strength of my spirit. I am not just a survivor; 
                            I am a warrior, and my purpose is to thrive. Every choice I make will honor the truth that 
                            life is short, precious, and unpredictable. So I will live like it's my last day—because 
                            one day, it will be. And when that day comes, I'll know I chose myself, every time."
