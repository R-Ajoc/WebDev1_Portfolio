	<br>
	<h2 style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">By K. J. Koshy</h2>
	<br>
	<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
	  	I knelt to pray but not for long,<br>
	  	I had too much to do.<br>
	  	I had to hurry and get to work<br>
	  	For bills would soon be due.
	</p>

	<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
	  	So I knelt and said a hurried prayer,<br>
	  	And jumped up off my knees.<br>
	  	My Christian duty was now done<br>
	  	My soul could rest at ease.
	</p>

	<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
	  	All day long I had no time<br>
	  	To spread a word of cheer.<br>
	  	No time to speak of Christ to friends,<br>
	  	They'd laugh at me I'd fear.
	</p>

	<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
	  	No time, no time, too much to do,<br>
	  	That was my constant cry,<br>
	  	No time to give to souls in need<br>
	  	But at last the time, the time to die.
	</p>

	<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
	  	I went before the Lord,<br>
	  	I came, I stood with downcast eyes.<br>
	  	For in his hands God held a book;<br>
	  	It was the book of life.
	</p>

	<p style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">
	  	God looked into his book and said<br>
	  	"Your name I cannot find.<br>
	  	I once was going to write it down...<br>
	  	But never found the time"
	</p>
